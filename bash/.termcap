# The termcap database is an obsolete facility for describing the capabilities of character-cell terminals and printers.
# It is retained only for capability with old programs; new programs should use the terminfo(5) database and associated libraries.
# /etc/termcap  is  an  ASCII  file  (the  database  master) 
# that lists the capabilities of many different types of terminals.  
# Programs can read termcap to find the particular escape codes needed to control the visual attributes of the terminal actually in use.
# (Other aspects of the terminal are handled by stty(1) 
# The termcap database is indexed on the TERM environment variable
